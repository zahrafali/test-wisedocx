# Table of Contents

You can generate table of contents with `docx`. More information can be found [here](http://officeopenxml.com/WPtableOfContents.php).

>Tables of Contents are fields and, by design, it's content is only generated or updated by Word. We can't do it programatically.
>This is why, when you open a the file, Word you will prompt the message "This document contains fields that may refer to other files. Do you want to update the fields in this document?".
>You have say yes to Word generate the content of all table of contents.

The complete documentation can be found [here](https://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-376.htm) (at Part 1, Page 1251).

## How to

All you need to do is create a `TableOfContents` object and assign it to the document.

```js
const toc = new TableOfContents("Summary", {
    hyperlink: true,
    headingStyleRange: "1-5",
    stylesWithLevels: [new StyleLevel("MySpectacularStyle", 1)]
});

doc.addTableOfContents(toc);
```

## Table of Contents Options

Here is the list of all options that you can use to generate your tables of contents:

| Option | Type | TOC Field Switch | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|captionLabel|string|`\a`|Includes captioned items, but omits caption labels and numbers. The identifier designated by `text` in this switch's field-argument corresponds to the caption label. Use ``\c`` to build a table of captions with labels and numbers.|
|entriesFromBookmark|string|`\b`|Includes entries only from the portion of the document marked by the bookmark named by `text` in this switch's field-argument.|
|captionLabelIncludingNumbers|string|`\c`|Includes figures, tables, charts, and other items that are numbered by a SEQ field (ยง17.16.5.56). The sequence identifier designated by `text` in this switch's field-argument, which corresponds to the caption label,  shall match the identifier in the corresponding SEQ field.|
|sequenceAndPageNumbersSeparator|string|`\d`|When used with `\s`, the `text` in this switch's field-argument defines the separator between sequence and page numbers. The default separator is a hyphen (-).|
|tcFieldIdentifier|string|`\f`|Includes only those TC fields whose identifier exactly matches the `text` in this switch's field-argument (which is typically a letter).|
|hyperlink|boolean|`\h`|Makes the table of contents entries hyperlinks.|
|tcFieldLevelRange|string|`\l`|Includes TC fields that assign entries to one of the levels specified by `text` in this switch's field-argument as a range having the form startLevel-endLevel, where startLevel and endLevel are integers, and startLevel has a value equal-to or less-than endLevel. TC fields that assign entries to lower levels are skipped.|
|pageNumbersEntryLevelsRange|string|`\n`|Without field-argument, omits page numbers from the table of contents. Page numbers are omitted from all levels unless a range of entry levels is specified by `text` in this switch's field-argument. A range is specified as for `\l`.|
|headingStyleRange|string|`\o`|Uses paragraphs formatted with all or the specified range of builtin heading styles. Headings in a style range are specified by `text` in this switch's field-argument using the notation specified as for `\l`, where each integer corresponds to the style with a style ID of HeadingX (e.g. 1 corresponds to Heading1). If no heading range is specified, all heading levels used in the document are listed.|
|entryAndPageNumberSeparator|string|`\p`|`text` in this switch's field-argument specifies a sequence of characters that separate an entry and its page number. The default is a tab with leader dots.|
|seqFieldIdentifierForPrefix|string|`\s`|For entries numbered with a SEQ field (ยง17.16.5.56), adds a prefix to the page number. The prefix depends on the type of entry. `text` in this switch's field-argument shall match the identifier in the SEQ field.|
|stylesWithLevels|StyleLevel[]|`\t`| Uses paragraphs formatted with styles other than the built-in heading styles. `text` in this switch's field-argument specifies those styles as a set of comma-separated doublets, with each doublet being a comma-separated set of style name and table of content level. `\t` can be combined with `\o`.|
|useAppliedParagraphOutlineLevel|boolean|`\u`|Uses the applied paragraph outline level.|
|preserveTabInEntries|boolean|`\w`|Preserves tab entries within table entries.|
|preserveNewLineInEntries|boolean|`\x`|Preserves newline characters within table entries.|
|hideTabAndPageNumbersInWebView|boolean|`\z`|Hides tab leader and page numbers in web page view (ยง17.18.102).|

## Examples

```js
// Let's define the options for generate a TOC for heading 1-5 and MySpectacularStyle,
// making the entries be hyperlinks for the paragraph
const toc = new TableOfContents("Summary", {
    hyperlink: true,
    headingStyleRange: "1-5",
    stylesWithLevels: [new StyleLevel("MySpectacularStyle", 1)]
});

doc.addTableOfContents(toc);

doc.addParagraph(new Paragraph("Header #1").heading1().pageBreakBefore());
doc.addParagraph(new Paragraph("I'm a little text, very nicely written.'"));

doc.addParagraph(new Paragraph("Header #2").heading1().pageBreakBefore());
doc.addParagraph(new Paragraph("I'm another text very nicely written.'"));
doc.addParagraph(new Paragraph("Header #2.1").heading2());
doc.addParagraph(new Paragraph("I'm another text very nicely written.'"));

doc.addParagraph(new Paragraph("My Spectacular Style #1").style("MySpectacularStyle").pageBreakBefore());
```
